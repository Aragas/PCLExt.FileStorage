PCLExt.FileStorage is a [bait-and-switch](http://ericsink.com/entries/pcl_bait_and_switch.html) library that was designed to implement a storage API in portable(PCL) projects.  
It was formely a basic fork of [PCL Storage](https://github.com/dsplaisted/PCLStorage), but later formed it's own set of API's designed to ease use of files and folders in managed code. It has a more "OOP" approach.
  
PCLExt.FileStorage supports .NET Framework (4.5), .NET Standard (2.0), Xamarin.iOS, Xamarin.Android, Xamarin.Mac and UWP.
This makes it easier to create cross-platform .NET libraries and apps.
